# MSU-Observatory

Contained in this repository is magnitude.py and a clean notebook that, when run, will plot light curves of a star and calculate the magnitudes of that star, as well as output the magnitudes in both CBA and AAVSO formats. If submitting to AAVSO, be sure to change the observer ID to your personal AAVSO ID before running the cell that outputs data in AAVSO format.

## Running the code
To run the code, you will need python (preferably 3.x) and the ability to run jupyter notebooks. Place the csv file in the same directory (folder) as the notebook and python file, then run each cell in the jupyter notebook, following the prompts given.
**Important note: for the notebook to run smoothly, the data file must be saved as a csv**
